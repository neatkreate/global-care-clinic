  Template file for Google Search Console HTML-file verification.
  Instructions:
  1. In Search Console choose "HTML file" verification.
  2. Google will give you a filename such as "google1234567890abcdef.html" and a small HTML payload.
  3. Rename this file to the exact filename Google provides and replace the contents with the exact payload (usually a single line token inside <meta> or body).
  4. Commit & push the renamed file to your repo, then in Search Console click "Verify".
  5. After successful verification you may delete the file if you prefer.

  Example (what Google might provide):
    Filename: google1234567890abcdef.html
    Content: <html><head><meta name="google-site-verification" content="1234567890abcdef" /></head><body>google-site-verification: 1234567890abcdef</body></html>
-->

<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Google site verification (TEMPLATE)</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Replace this file with the exact HTML file provided by Google Search Console.
